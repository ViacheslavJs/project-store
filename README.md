# React - frontend application

## About the project:

The original idea was:

 - Reusing the same component for modal windows.
 - My implementation of the shopping cart (frontend).
 - Everything is based on functional components.

Used the following approaches:

 - Dynamic import using asynchronous functions 
 (allows you to defer rendering of elements while the page is loading) - 
 `Fullstack.js` file. 

Work on the project continues.
